        device-specific information to help the user decide on which devices the
        user would like purchases to be available for use. In mobile applications,
        Google Play may use identifiers specific to your device to serve you more
        relevant advertisements. More information on Google’s privacy policy can

        <em>Mobile Platforms.</em> If you use or access the Platform on your
        mobile device and/or tablet, we receive information about you from the app
        stores and other mobile platform providers. This information includes your
        username and/or device ID and the fact that you made a purchase, for
        instance, but does not include any sensitive or financial information.
        Some of our mobile platforms also may send information to us that you
        authorize them to provide. Our mobile products also may request additional
        personal information from you, such as push notification tokens, your
        precise location or contact list, and we will collect this information
        only if you give us your explicit consent.

          <strong>WHAT ARE OUR LEGAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR PROCESSING DATA?</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Data protection and privacy laws usually require us to have a legal basis
        or lawful grounds for handling personal information. Broadly, that means
        that we have to have a legal justification for handling your personal
        information. For the most part, we need to handle your personal
        information to be able to:
      </p>
      <p>
        — &nbsp;&nbsp;provide you with the products or services that you have
        asked for; and
      </p>
      <p>
        — &nbsp;&nbsp;for our Platform to be able to work properly and to do all
        the things that you expect them to.
      </p>
      <p>
        We rely on our contractual arrangements with you as the lawful basis on
        which we collect and process your personal data when you make an order for
        products and services. Sometimes, our use of your personal information is
        not strictly necessary for us to be able to provide you with our products
        and services, or for them to work properly. In those circumstances, we
        have what&apos;s called a &quot;legitimate interest&quot; in handling your personal
        information; our &quot;legitimate interest&quot; may be to:
      </p>
      <p>— &nbsp;&nbsp;detect and prevent fraud;</p>
      <p>
        — &nbsp;&nbsp;keep our websites, apps, products and IT systems secure;
      </p>
      <p>
        — &nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that our own processes, procedures and systems are as
        efficient as possible;
      </p>
      <p>— &nbsp;&nbsp;analyze and enhance the information that we collect;</p>
      <p>
        — &nbsp;&nbsp;determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and
        advertising; and
      </p>
      <p>
        — &nbsp;&nbsp;customize and improve the way that you shop and engage with
        us in future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where we rely on our legitimate interests, we will always make sure that
        we find the balance between these interests and your rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, we will use your personal data because it is necessary for
        us to comply with a legal obligation (such as if we receive a legitimate
        request from a law enforcement agency).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, there will be certain personal information that you share with us
        which we specify as being optional (for example, to send you advertising
        and marketing communications or to monitor your use of the Platform). We
        will ask you to provide a consent for such data processing to confirm that
        you are agreeing to our use of your information in that way. You can ask
        us to delete that information at any time by filling out this form.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter the location we collect explicit consent from all users in order
        to send our marketing emails. To join the subscribers’ list you should
        give us your consent to receive such newsletter. You can opt out of

        transaction could be fraudulent. They are responsible for their use of
        your personal information and will use it for the purposes set out in
        their Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we can share your personal information with companies,
        organizations, or individuals outside of the Company in the following
        cases
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is
          required by or otherwise in accordance with any applicable law,
          regulation or legal process;
        </li>
        <li>
          to protect the rights, property and safety of the Lambo or others;

        <li>
          with your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you
          through the Platform that the information you provide will be shared in
          a particular manner and you provide such information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will also share your personal information if we are required to do so
        by law, including in response to a legal process, such as a court order or
        subpoena, or to comply with other national, state, provincial or local
        laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot
        reasonably be used to identify you. When we provide this information, we
        perform appropriate procedures so that the information does not identify
        you and we contractually prohibit recipients of the data from
        re-identifying this information to associate the information with you.

        long as we are required to keep it by law. The actual period for which we
        store your personal information will vary depending on the type of
        personal information and how it is used. For example, when you buy a
        product from us, we will store information about you and your purchase for
        at least the term of your warranty or guarantee.

        In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request certain
        copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled
        to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in
        a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us

      <p>
        We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary
        for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with
        our legal obligations. In certain jurisdictions, you can request to have
        all your personal information deleted entirely. Please note that if you
        request the erasure of your personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          we may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our
          legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention
          and enhancing safety.
        </li>
        <li>
          we may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary
          to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of
          your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          information you have shared with others (e.g., reviews, forum postings)
          may continue to be publicly visible on the Platform, even after your
          account is canceled. However, the attribution of such information to you
          will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g.,
          log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from
          personal identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
          because we maintain the Lambo Platform to protect from accidental or
          malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal
          information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited
          period of time.

      </ol>
      <p>
        If we are processing your personal information based on your consent you
        may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your account settings or
        by filling out this form. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent
        does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such

          </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Lambo not
        to process your personal information for certain specific purposes
        (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate
        interest. If you object to such processing Lambo will no longer process
        your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate
        compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is
        required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing
        purposes, you may, at any time ask Lambo to cease processing your data for
        these direct marketing purposes by filling out this form.

          <strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We are committed to protecting your personal information. We use
        appropriate technical and organizational measures, including encryption,
        to protect your personal information and privacy, and review those
        regularly. We protect your personal information using a combination of
        physical and IT security controls, including access controls that restrict
        and manage the way in which your personal information and data are
        processed, managed, and handled. We also ensure that our staff is
        adequately trained in protecting your personal information. Our procedures
        mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we share
        your personal information with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, however, no security system is 100% secure, and we cannot
        guarantee that the information we collect from you will be free from
        unauthorized access by third parties. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware
        or software failure and other factors may compromise the security of user
        information. Your password is an important component of our security
        system, and as a result it is your responsibility to protect your
        password. Do not share your password with any third parties. If your
        password has been compromised for any reason, you should change your
        password immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the unlikely event that we do suffer a security breach which
        compromises our protection of your personal information and we need to let
        you know about it, we will do so.

          <strong>TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We may need to transfer your personal data to other countries, in the
        following circumstances:
      </p>
      <p>
        — &nbsp;&nbsp;where you have requested a service which is fulfilled by one
        of our group companies which sit outside of your country; or
      </p>
      <p>
        — &nbsp;&nbsp;where we work with a supplier that processes some of its
        personal data outside of your country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foreign countries may not have the same data protection laws as yours and
        so your personal data may not be subject to the same protections. However,
        in such cases, we will take efforts to make sure that any transfer of your
        personal data to countries outside of yours is subject to appropriate
        safeguards and under the guiding principles set out in this Privacy
        Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, our transfer, storage, and handling of your personal
        information will continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy. If you
        would like further information about the global handling of your personal
        information, please contact us by filling out this form.

        information from a child, we will delete that information as soon as
        possible.

        We may need to change this page from time to time in order to address new
        issues and reflect changes on the Platform. We will post those changes
        here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might
        use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to
        anyone. If we are required by applicable data protection laws to give you
        enhanced notice or seek your consent for any such changes, we will do so.
        Any revised Privacy Policy will supersede all previous privacy policies.
