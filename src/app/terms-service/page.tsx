          provide accurate, current and complete information during the
          registration process and to update such information to keep it

        <p>
          In addition, to create a Lambo Account, Lambo may require you to
          select a username and password. You acknowledge that you shall be
          responsible for ensuring that any username you select does not
          infringe any third-party rights and is not otherwise unlawful. Lambo
          may refuse to grant you a username in Lambo’s sole discretion for any
          reason including if the proposed username impersonates or misleadingly
          implies an association with the persona of another person or entity,
          is or may be illegal, is or may be protected by trademark or other
          proprietary rights, is vulgar or otherwise offensive, or may cause
          confusion, or for any other reason as determined by Lambo in Lambo’s
          sole discretion. Your selection and use of a specific username do not
          convey any ownership or rights in that username and Lambo reserves the
          right to revoke and/or reassign that username in Lambo’s sole
          discretion. You understand and agree that Lambo reserves the right to
          change, remove, alter or delete any username, with or without prior
          notice to you, at any time and for any reason in Lambo’s sole
          discretion. YOU ARE ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE
          CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD AND ALL ACCESS TO AND
          USE OF YOUR LAMBO ACCOUNT, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING
          USE OF THE LAMBO PLATFORM, AS APPLICABLE) THAT ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH
          THE USE OF YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD WHETHER OR NOT AUTHORIZED BY
          YOU. YOUR LAMBO ACCOUNT MAY BE SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED IF SOMEONE ELSE
          USES YOUR LAMBO ACCOUNT TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITY THAT VIOLATES THESE
          LAMBO TERMS.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree to notify Lambo immediately of any unauthorized use of your
          Lambo Account. We reserve the right to close your Lambo Account at any
          time if you violate these Lambo Terms or if we otherwise have a
          legitimate interest to do so, such as complying with a legal or
          regulatory obligation.

          Lambo has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of
          claimed copyright infringement and for processing such claims in
          accordance with applicable law. In accordance with the Digital
          Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &quot;DMCA&quot;), a summary of which may
          be found on the U.S. Copyright Office website at
          http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf, Lambo will respond
          expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement committed using the
          Lambo Platform if such claims are reported to Lambo’s Designated
          Copyright Agent identified in the notice below.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a copyright owner, authorized to act on behalf of a
          copyright owner, or authorized to act under any exclusive right under
          copyright, please report any alleged copyright infringements taking
          place on or through the Lambo Platforms by completing the DMCA Notice
          of Alleged Infringement and delivering the Notice to Lambo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon receipt of a DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement, Lambo will take
          whatever action, in Lambo’s sole discretion, that Lambo deems
          appropriate, which may include the removal of, or disabling of access
          to, the challenged material from the Lambo Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event Lambo, after receiving a proper DMCA Notice of Alleged
          Infringement, takes steps to remove or disable access to the
          challenged material, Lambo will take reasonable steps to promptly
          notify the party who originally posted such challenged material to the
          Lambo Platform that Lambo has removed or disabled access to such
          challenged material. Please note that pursuant to Section 512(f) of
          the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that
          material or activity is infringing, or that the material or activity
          was removed or disabled by mistake may be subject to liability. Please
          also be advised that Lambo enforces a policy of terminating the Lambo
          Accounts of, or banning, repeat infringers. A repeat infringer
          includes any user who has made two or more postings that Lambo has
          removed or disabled access to pursuant to notices of infringement
          under these DMCA notice and takedown procedures.

          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>Lambo does not tolerate any of the behaviors described below:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Spam: Do not send the same message to multiple Members or repeatedly
            post the same message in the post, exercise, question or other
            sections of the Lambo Platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commercial Advertisements: Do not contact other Members for
            commercial purposes. In addition, do not create posts or comments
            that are solely for commercial purposes since this detracts from,
            and does not add anything of value to, the language-learning
            community.
          </li>
          <li>
            Search for a Romantic Relationship: Do not contact other Lambo
            Members for dating, or to find sexual partners. This is improper
            conduct, and might be treated as harassment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Harassment, Bullying, or Stalking: Lambo does not tolerate
            harassment, bullying or stalking. Lambo may, at its sole discretion,
            take action on the reports of harassment, bullying and stalking.
            Repeatedly messaging another user with unwanted friend requests or
            messages is harassment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Impersonation: Do not claim to be another person, or seek to mislead
            others as to your identity by copying another Member’s avatar, using
            a user name that is misleadingly similar to another Member or
            otherwise posing as another Member. Do not create a false presence
            for an organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal Information of Others: Do not post on the Lambo Platform
            other people’s personal information, such as phone number, private
            email address, physical address, credit card number, passwords
            and/or any other similar personal identifiable information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Threat of Violence: Do not threaten violence towards other people,
            or use the Lambo Platform to organize, promote, or incite acts of
            real-world violence or terrorism.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hate Speech and Offensive Language: Do not post any content, send
            any messages or otherwise take any actions on the Lambo Platform
            that attacks others based on their body size, personal appearance,
            level of experience, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender,
            sexual orientation, disability or medical condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sexually Obscene Content: Do not post any pornographic content, any
            sexually explicit content or any content that display nudity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pirated Content: Do not post any content infringes any third party’s
            intellectual property rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            Self-Harm: Do not post any content that promotes or encourages
            self-harm such as self-mutilation, eating disorders, drug abuse or
            suicide.
          </li>
          <li>
            Defamation: Do not post any content on the Lambo Platform that is
            intended to, or would reasonably be expected to, harm Lambo or our
            brand, including the images and reputations of our employees,
            agents, and officers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Political or Religious Discussions: Do not initiate or participate
            in discussions or post images that relate to political or religious
            events or groups. Politics and religion are sensitive topics that
            often lead to polarizing and hateful comments. It is our position to
            not have these types of discussions on a site that is meant for
            language learning.

          We may suspend or cancel your Lambo Account if we believe that you
          have violated or acted in a manner that is inconsistently with the
          letter or the spirit of these Lambo Terms, or violated our rights or
          those of a third-party in connection with your use of the Lambo
          Platform. Without limiting Lambo&apos;s other remedies, we will suspend,
          cancel or terminate your Lambo Account, suspend your ability to use
          certain portions of the Lambo Platform, freeze or confiscate your
          Lambo Credits (as defined in the Payment Policy) and/or ban you
          altogether from the Lambo Platform, without notice or liability of any
          kind, if: (a) you breach any terms and conditions of these Lambo Terms
          or any other written policies and procedures posted on the Lambo
          Platform, including but not limited to Lambo Policies; (b) we are
          unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or

          our Members or for Lambo.

        <p>
          Once suspended or terminated, you may not continue to use the Lambo
          Platform under a different Lambo Account or re-register under a new
          Lambo Account. This includes usage of any associated Payment Services.
          In addition, violations of these Lambo Terms may be prosecuted to the
          fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and
          sanctions. If you engage in actions or activities which circumvent the
          Lambo Platform or otherwise reduce service fees owed or paid to Lambo
          under these Lambo Terms, you will be liable to Lambo for the full
          amount of the service fees due, and may be subject to additional
          sanctions including, but not limited to, suspension or termination of
          your Lambo Account. Lambo reserves the right to terminate any Member
          or project for any reason, at its sole discretion and to refuse to
          provide registration and membership to you in the future. If your

          the Lambo Platform have been inactive for more than twelve (12)
          months. To the extent that you violate these Lambo Terms and we revoke
          the licenses granted to you, you will lose all benefits and privileges

          We reserve the right to stop making available any one or more of the
          Lambo Platform, at any time, whether on a temporary or permanent basis
          and without any liability, compensation, refunds or other compensatory
          benefits to you. Your license to the Lambo Platform automatically ends
          when we terminate access to such Lambo Platform. Any such action could
          prevent you from accessing your Lambo Account, the Lambo Platform, any
          Lambo Content, or any other related information.

          Except as they may be supplemented by additional Lambo policies,

          hereof, and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings

          effect. Lambo may assign or transfer these Lambo Terms, and any rights
          or obligations hereunder, at its sole discretion, without restriction.
          Subject to the foregoing, these Lambo Terms will bind and inure to the

          sends the communication to the email address you have provided to
          Lambo on the Lambo Platform, or when Lambo posts such communication on
          the Lambo Platform. You must keep your email address updated on the
          Lambo Platform, and you must regularly check the Lambo Platform for
          postings. If you fail to respond to an email message from Lambo
          regarding violation, dispute or complaint within two business days,
          Lambo will have the right to terminate or suspend your Lambo Account.

          The failure of Lambo to enforce any right or provision of these Lambo
          Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right
          or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be
          effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
          representative of Lambo. Except as expressly set forth in these Lambo
          Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these
          Lambo Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under
          these Lambo Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a
          court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Lambo
          Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the
          maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Lambo
          Terms will remain in full force and effect.
